To see the code I wrote go to firmware_common --> application --> user_app1.c

Description:
  Basic menu system
  
  
Contains:
  A few menu states

Requires:
  User input to generate number (seed)
  
Returns:
  A random number (seed) that gets used by RandomNumberGenerator (not yet coded as of 2020-02-16)
  And what state should go next by default make it easy
